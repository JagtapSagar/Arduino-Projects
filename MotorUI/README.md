Assignment 2 Description
========================

The project consists on building a circuit with the Arduino Pro Mini to control a stepper motor and a RC servo motor using an LCD display / touchscreen as user interface.

An LCD touch screen will be used to enter a position command in degrees that the motors will rotate.  This will be an integer between 0 and 360 for the stepper, and 0 to 90 for the RC servo.  A rotation command will be prompted on the LCD display, and the number entered should be echoed at the LCD.

•	On start, prompt the user to select which motor to drive (servo  or stepper)  
•	Direction should be prompted as CW/CCW  
•	After holding position for “n” seconds, the motor returns to the zero position.  
•	Program returns to the start prompt
